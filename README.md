## What is it?
RuneBot is a Discord bot that aims to be an emulation of RuneScape, much like the concept behind [Pok√©bot](https://github.com/Wonder-Toast/Pokebot).

## Setup
A config.yaml file must be made in the source root. The format for the YAML file is as follows:
```
messageCooldown: SECONDS
jdbc:
  url: "jdbc:postgresql://ADDRESS:PORT(typically 5432)/DB_NAME"
  driver: "org.postgresql.Driver"
  username: "DB_USERNAME"
  password: "DB_PASSWORD"
discord:
  token: "TOKEN AS PER DISCORDAPP.COM"
```
After that, simply run RuneBot.kt!

## Features
- Creation of a character, made by using any command. Your character is linked to your discord account.
- Training of skills.
```
r.train SKILL
```
- A help command to list all the commands available.
```
r.help
```
